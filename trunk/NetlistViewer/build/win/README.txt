Please download and compile with VisualStudio both wxWidgets 3.0 and Boost >= 1.58.
Then define the following 2 environment variables:

  WXWIN        to point to the base root of your wxWidgets directory
  BOOST_DIR    to point to the base root of your Boost directory
  
For more info on how to do it, please look on Google, e.g.:

Finally open the netlist_viewer_vs2017.sln project and you should be able to build it.
