# netlist-viewer

Netlist Viewer is a tool capable of loading SPICE netlists and convert them in a schematic (i.e. graphical) format.
The graphical representations helps to understand the electrical/electronic circuit represented by the SPICE netlist, and save some tedious work.

# Past versions of Netlist-viewer

Past versions were hosted in Sourceforge, see https://sourceforge.net/projects/netlistviewer/.
All new developments have been moved into this Github project.

# Status

The software is usable even if it could be improved very much.
Since the creation of the project (2010) I have not been using this tool anymore (I'm not doing any HW design anymore) so this software will not be further improved unless someone else wants to step up to improve it.
Pull requests are of course welcome anyhow.
